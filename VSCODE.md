## Column mode (like Notepad++)
SHIFT + ALT + downArrow

## Move a line Up or Down
ALT + upArrow
ALT + downArrow

## Duplicate line
File->Preferences->KeyboardShortcuts
* Copy Line Down: will be set to CTRL+SHIFT+ALT+downArrow
    * But this does NOT work for Ubuntu
* Set it to CTRL+D 
    * Like Spyder
    * If there is a binding already for CTRL+D, delete it!!!
